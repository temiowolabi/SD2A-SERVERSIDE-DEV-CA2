# Comments

This is a College Project for a Module called Server Side Development. 
In th future, I'd like to understand how to add nested comment sections to the project. Users would be able to comment on posts and other users could add comments to that. I would probably try and add topics (which is something I tried to do but was unsuccessful) where users can add different posts into different topics.
